## Why and What
* This project created for study purposes and simulates user actions on **[hurriyetemlak.com](http://www.hurriyetemlak.com)** (which is a real estate advertizement website) such as checking for getting advertisement information, filter usage and taking a close look to published advertizements. 
* Project uses browser user-agent information to simulate platforms like Linux, Macintosh, Android, Chrome and Safari on screen resolutions such as 1920x1080, 1366x768, 360x640, 375x667.

## Technologies
* **IntelliJ Idea**
* **Selenium**
* **TestNG**
* **Zalenium**
* **Docker**

## Getting Started
* Following steps will be explaining how to setup your Zalenium environment, how to clone this project and run in on your system. (This readMe file is partially created by help of [this](https://github.com/zalando/zalenium#getting-started) documentation.)

### Prerequisites
* Docker engine running, version >= 1.11.1 (probably works with earlier versions, not tested yet).
* Make sure your docker daemon is running (e.g. docker info works without errors).

### Setup
* Pull the [docker-selenium](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium) image.
```
  # Pull docker-selenium
  $ docker pull elgalu/selenium

  # Pull Zalenium
  $ docker pull dosel/zalenium
```

### Run
* Zalenium uses docker to scale on-demand, therefore we need to give it the docker.sock full access, this is known as "Docker alongside docker".
```
  $  docker run --rm -ti --name zalenium -p 4444:4444 \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -v /tmp/videos:/home/seluser/videos \
      --privileged dosel/zalenium start --desiredContainers 8
```
If everything is fine you should see something like this in your terminal.(with "--desiredContainers 8")

## Getting Test Case
* This part explains how to clone this project from Github and run it on your system and in case of it's running too slow on your system will contain additional information to reduce source usage.

### Cloning Project from Github
* Go to your folder that you desire project to be in.
* Clone project from Github.
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/koulgar/HurriyetEmlakStudyCase
```

### Importing Project with Maven
* Importing project as maven project.
  * For Eclipse you can check **[this]**(https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.5.x/java/EclipseMavenInt.html) link.
  * For IntelliJ you can check **[this]**(https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.5.x/java/IntellijMaven.html) link.
  
### Running Test Cases
* Run "testng.xml" file to run all test cases. 

## Docker Run Parameters
* **--rm** - remove container automatically after it exits
* **--ti** - connect the container to terminal
* **--name** - name the container
* **-p (x):(y)** - expose port **x** externally and map to port **y**
* **-v** - create a host mapped volume inside the container
* **--privileged** - gives all the capabilities to the container and also access to the hostâ€™s devices
* **--desiredContainers** - Number of nodes/containers created on startup (2 is default value.)

## Checkout If Tests Are Too Slow
* On docker run parameters "--desiredContainers 8" is not a default parameter. In case of test process takes too long on your system you can just use fewer containers instead of "8" or just delete whole parameter for default value which is assigned as "2".
In this case you should see something like this when you run docker image.

* Another option is to use fewer threads in your "testng.xml" file. Threads are amount of simultaneous test process  that your system will run. Which in this project it's assigned as "8". Using fewer threads such as "3" will ease down things. You can see location of "threads" parameter below.
